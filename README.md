# AquaSmart – Smart Water Temperature Control System

AquaSmart is a complete smart water management system combining:

- 📱 Mobile application (Flutter MVP)
- 🔌 ESP32-S2 embedded control unit
- 💧 Flow and temperature sensor hardware
- ⚙️ Closed-loop PI-based temperature control
- 🌐 WiFi-based remote communication

This repository includes both the mobile demo application and the embedded hardware/firmware design.

# AquaSmart Flutter MVP

Demo mobile application for checking water consumption and controlling temperature.

## Features & Screens

### 1. Dashboard (Main Screen)
The heart of the application, designed for easy control and monitoring.
- **Modern Temperature Control**: A sleek, large circular slider to set your target water temperature (20°C - 60°C).
- **Profile Switching**: 
  - Switch between **Father**, **Mother**, and **Child** profiles.
  - **Randomized Data**: Each profile has its own unique consumption habits and history. Switching profiles instantly refreshes the data to demonstrate personalization.
- **Smart Efficiency Alert**: visual feedback (Green Banner) when the temperature is set to an eco-friendly level (<40°C).
- **"Start Shower" Simulation Mode**: 
  - **Demo Feature**: Press the large **"START SHOWER"** button to simulate a live shower session.
  - **Real-Time Tracking**: Watch the *Session Liters* and *Cost* rise second-by-second (simulating 9L/min flow).
  - **Live Cost Calculation**: Costs are calculated dynamically based on usage.

### 2. Statistics
- **Weekly Consumption**: A clear bar chart showing water usage for the last 7 days.
- **Interactive Labels**: Dark, readable text showing days of the week.
- **Insight**: Helpful text summaries (e.g., "10% lower than last week").

### 3. Architecture & Tech Stack
- **State Management**: Built with `flutter_riverpod` for robust and reactive state.
- **Mock Data Engine**: A sophisticated simulation engine (`WaterControlNotifier`) that generates realistic usage data and handles the time-based shower simulation.
- **Charts**: Uses `fl_chart` for beautiful, animated graphical data.
